# Python-project
The Random OTP Generator project is a simple yet powerful Python-based application designed to generate secure One-Time Passwords (OTPs). OTPs are widely used in authentication systems to verify user identities and enhance security during login, registration, or transaction processes.

This project utilizes Python’s built-in libraries such as random and string to create random numeric or alphanumeric OTPs of customizable lengths. It ensures randomness and unpredictability, making the generated OTPs suitable for use in various real-world applications like online banking, email verification, and secure login systems.

The program can be easily extended or integrated with other systems to send OTPs via email or SMS. It demonstrates the concept of randomization, data security, and modular coding in Python.
